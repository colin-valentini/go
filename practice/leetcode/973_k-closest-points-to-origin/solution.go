package kclosestpointstoorigin

// LeetCode #973.
// https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

// Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on
// the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin
// (0, 0).

// The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance
// (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

// You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique
// (except for the order that it is in).

// Example 1:
// Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
// Output: [[-2,2]]
// Explanation:
// The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
// The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
// Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
// We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just
// [[-2,2]].

// Example 2:
// Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
// Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
// Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

// Constraints:
// - 1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
// - -10^4 < xi, yi < 10^4

// Solve solves the K Closest Points to Origin problem.
//
// This solution creates a min heap of points in the plane.
// It then pops off enough elements to fulfill k (or less than k if
// we were provided with len(points) = N < k). It relies on the property
// that all min heaps pop the minimum value.
//
// Time: O(N+k*log(N)), Space: O(N).
// The reason the time complexity is linear in N is because heap construction
// is linear (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/18742428). We also need to pop
// at most k elements, which is a log(N) heap operation.
//
